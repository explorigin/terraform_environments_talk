					<h2>Story time</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In Dec 2020, we were requested to add tags to all of our cloud assets. We initially didn't think much of the request because our infrastructure was already managed by terraform and we applied certain tags to our assets.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, through a magic combination of terraform versioning, and how the different accounts and environments were setup, it was not something would easily do.
						</p>
						<p>
							To support the requested tags, we would need to upgrade terraform versions. To upgrade terraform versions, we would need to change many of the third-party modules we were using. The patterns of those modules were slightly different so our infrastructure assets would be either renamed or recreated. While terraform is amazing, the Amazon API is not and things occasionally break. There was no way that I could guarantee customer uptime through this process by doing a "cold-turkey" switch.
						</p>
						<p>
							This small request for a few tags snowballed into an effort that took several months. But in those months I learned a lot and I want to share some of that with you today.

								Aside from typing out some code into files, we have also gone into the AWS console and created some infrastructure assets: an AWS account (with API credentials), an S3 bucket that we've configured to serve our static files to the public internet, and we've uploaded our files into this bucket.

								The first one is having one cloud account per app environment. What this means is that our project uses one aws account for its production environment and a separate account for the test environment. If we were to add a staging environment ...you guessed it...we would need another AWS account. Having these distinct accounts provides you...
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<p>
								...stability because you need a place to develop and test infrastructure configurations that shouldn't be even remotely close to your production code.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Another benefit is...simpler security because its far less difficult to segregate users by account than within an account.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It also provides you...easier analytics because all of your production costs and usage data are confined to one account making them easier to analyse.

							#### Small repositories

							(refactorable) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
													
							Notes: The next "best practice" to talk about is keeping small repositories. "Small" here is relative. I'll try to explain what I mean by going back to the story about Astra.

							Astra was originally configured as one terraform repository. When I needed to jump from one terraform version to the next, I was forced to deal with all of the assets changing at once. Astra is not your average bear. It has:

								- fargate containers
								- load balancers
								- lambdas
								- DNS records
								- dynamo tables
								- kinesis streams
								- cloudwatch logs
								- and I'm probably forgetting some things (secretsmanager)


							If Astra was originally built as it is now, I could update the lambda definitions without needing to worry the fargate definitions.
							
							--

							The point is, if you can't manage a syntax-breaking major version upgrade, then consider breaking your repository into smaller, separate repos. By separate, I mean with their own individual state bucket objects.

							---
							#### Limited External Modules

							(understand the tradeoff) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

							Notes: I'm not totally against using external modules in terraform but they are the same trap that you run into with any declaritive infrastructure management tool. If they change, your infrastructure may need a large rewrite to accomodate the change. Suddenly all the time you saved by using the convenience module up front, gets swallowed up in maintenance costs.

							-- 

							For Terraform, stick with provider resources as much as development time allows.

							---
							#### Tags

							- Help you keep track of things
							- [There is a tagging standard](https://one.rackspace.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=532306599)
							- Tag your unmanaged infrastructure assets

							Notes: Tags are just a darn-good idea. Besides, there is a standard. AWS console also allows you to search by tags. If you tag your unmanaged infrastructure assets, it makes them easier to find later if you need to find undeclared infrastructure assets.

						<h3>Multi-Environment Methods</h3>

								Hard-code more resources for each environment

								Use distinct root directories for each environment

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								We're finally here. Our app is gaining traction but we haven't finished all that we set out to do before. Consider what might happen if we try to setup a caching infrastructure. If we put that in front of our production setup anything but a perfect configuration the first time will result in downtime. Assuming our current setup is production, how do we setup a "test" environment. Some options are:
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We could copy and paste all of our code, but that would violate the separate accounts best practice.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We could have variable maps for each environment and use keyed workspaces but this makes for a lot of boilerplate and some brittle architecture if you try to split things apart. It's also complicated to setup with multiple accounts. This is how Astra used to be configured.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The best method I've found is to have a distinct root directory for each environment. Before we can appreciate the benefits, let's look a little deeper into workspaces...

						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Workspaces provide a unique state per workspace within one repository root. So far in our example project, we have not specified a workspace. Terraform assumes the "default" workspace so that's the one we've been using for our webapp. However, if we were to have a "prod" and a "test" workspace, then we could have unique state and share one repo. But this configuration is not ideal because of our options to specify environment-specific values.

						<h4>To specify environment-specific variables you have 2 options:</h4>

							<p>
								There are 2 ways to specify values with workspaces in an environment-specific way.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								You could create tfvars files for each environment and pass those in on the command line. This is brittle because if you're working on the command line, you may have forgotten which workspace you're in unless you just changed or checked. Even Hashicorp does not recommend this method.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The second method is to specify all your values as default map values in your variables file at the root of your repository and access them keyed to the workspace name. Each value would need to be written like this:

								Since we've moved our terraform repository root, we also change how we call terraform. I prefer to specify the environment as a terminal environment variable and pass `chdir` to terraform. this way I only have three scripts defined in my package.json file instead of environments * 3 scripts if everything was statically included.

								For each self-contained area of infrastructure, we add a directory suffix. This setup has a few nuances to it. First, we could add another directory level. I've chosen to recommend a suffix because most terminals show your most immediate directory. If you're in that directory it is always obvious what environment you're in.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								 The next nuance is that we've done away with the root module. Since we're focusing on parts of the whole, different environments should reference modules directly in order to reuse code.

						<h4>That's too messy</h4>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Not likely a problem in a development context</li>
							<li class="fragment">Not difficult to write a script to do it once in CI/CD.</li>

								It might seem messy to just say "run terraform more times in more places", but the wisdom is built into the same reasons that we break up large repositories of other types. If you consider the access patterns for this setup, it works pretty well.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								 In a development context, you're likely only working in one account at a time. If you find yourself hopping between accounts a lot, then prehaps your modules need to be reorganized.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								 In CI/CD, you specify them once and run them a lot.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								 Finally, there are terraform wrappers like terragrunt to help you abstract away some of the repetition of larger numbers of repository roots. Under the hood, terragrunt organizes things very similar to what I've described here.
